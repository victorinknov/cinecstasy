## Introduction 
This project was made with the aim of developing a web application that would allow the purchase of **movie tickets** and show **snackbar options**.

## Running project

## Creating database
After NPM installs the **node_modules**, you will need to run the database script. Open the shell in the 'database' folder and type: 'mysql -u x -p y -A < "db.sql";' Where 'X' are your MySQL username and Y your password.
